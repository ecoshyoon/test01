    <h1>Impact of prior distributions of energy model inputs on prediction of building energy retrofits</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In order to reduce the performance gap between the reality and energy prediction,
        <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9868.00294/pdf" target="_blank" title="Bayesian calibration of
        computer models">Bayesian calibration</a> of building simulation models have been highlighted since it can take into account the stochastic nature of building systems.
        However, for the use of Bayesian calibration, quantification of prior information on uncertain inputs is a prerequisite.
        In general, the prior information on the uncertain inputs are not well established in the literature.
        Therefore, uncertain inputs are usually determined by subjective judgment of simulation users</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">However, the results of Bayesian calibration can be significantly influenced by
        the prior distributions of simulation inputs. In this paper, the authors aim to assess the impact of the prior
        distributions of simulation inputs on Bayesian calibration of a given energy model and decision making of
        building energy retrofits. The author performed Bayesian calibration using two different prior distributions
        (uniform and normal). Then, two different prior distributions were propagated. Based on the propagated
        simulation outputs, decision making of building energy retrofit scenarios was studied. It is concluded
        that the decision making of energy retrofits is significantly influenced by the prior distributions of inputs.</p>
